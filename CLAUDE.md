# CODE STYLE GUIDELINES
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- React components should use function declarations with named exports
- Use "use client" directive for client components
- Prefer interface over type for object definitions
- Imports order: React/Next.js core, external libraries, internal components
- Use absolute imports with @/ prefix for project files
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with className
- Use framer-motion for animations
- Handle errors with try/catch blocks
- Use consistent naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- Follow React hooks naming conventions (useXxx)
- Responsive design: mobile-first approach
